A fast-paced and unpredictable chess variant played on a crowded 4x8 board. All 32 standard chess pieces start hidden, creating a "fog of war" where strategy and luck collide. Players must decide whether to reveal new pieces or maneuver the ones they already control to capture their opponent's army and rack up the highest score.

## Game Features

* **4x8 Crowded Board:** 32 pieces on 32 squares means no empty space at the start!
* **Fog of War Setup:** All pieces begin face-down and are randomly placed.
* **Flip or Move:** On your turn, you can either reveal a new hidden piece or move one of your revealed pieces.
* **Score-Based Victory:** The game ends only when the last piece on the board is flipped. The player with the highest score wins!
* **Red vs. Blue Theme:** A clear and fun color scheme replaces the traditional White and Black.

## Gameplay Summary

1.  **Start:** Player 1 flips any hidden piece to begin the game.
2.  **Assign Colors:** The revealed piece's color (Red or Blue) is assigned to Player 2. Player 1 gets the opposite color.
3.  **Take Turns:** Players take turns either flipping a new piece or moving an existing piece according to standard chess rules.
4.  **Win the Game:** The game ends when the 32nd and final piece is revealed. Scores are then calculated.

## Special Rules

* **No Check or Checkmate:** The King is just another piece that can be captured. Protect it carefully based on its high point value!
* **No Pawn Promotion:** Pawns that reach the opposite side of the board remain as Pawns.
* **The Golden Rule:** You can only move your own revealed pieces, and you can only capture an opponent's piece that has also been revealed. Hidden pieces cannot be captured and block movement.
